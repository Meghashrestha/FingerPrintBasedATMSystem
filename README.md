# FingerPrintBasedATMSystem

## Overview
Fingerprint Based ATM System provides enhanced security for transactions by utilizing biometric authentication. This system ensures secure access to ATM services by identifying and verifying users through their fingerprints, reducing reliance on traditional PIN-based methods.

## Features
- **Fingerprint Identification:** Secure authentication via fingerprint recognition.
- **Database Verification:** Comparison of fingerprint and PIN with SQL server database.
- **Limited Trials:** Block card after 3 unsuccessful attempts.
- **Enhanced Security:** Minimize fraud, hacking, and skimming risks.
- **Convenience:** Eliminate need for remembering or carrying PIN.

## Scope
Implemented biometric security using Python and integrate with ATM systems. Ensure compatibility with Windows/UNIX, SQL Server, and use HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front end.

## Technologies Used
- **Operating System:** Windows/UNIX
- **Database System:** SQL Server
- **Front End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back End:** Python
- **Interpreter:** PyCharm
